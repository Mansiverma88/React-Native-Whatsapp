## General Information
- The purpose of the project was to develop a real-time bidirectional Chat-app application using React JS and socketIO
- Web socket is two-way connect from one end to another, client to server, to push data.
- Whenever client requests a resource/service, only then server pushes data to network to transported to client. Without a request, a response is never puched by server itslef. In order to create a real time application,  a link between sever and client needs to be present fr server to push data to client whenver an update is seen.
- For client and server to make a two-way connection, web socket is used, implemented by JS's Socket IO.
